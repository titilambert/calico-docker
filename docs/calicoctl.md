# calicoctl command line interface user reference

The command line tool, `calicoctl`, makes it easy to configure and start Calico
services and to manage Calico network and security policy.

The tool provides a simple interface for using Calico networking with Docker
containers.  In addition, many of the calicoctl commands are useful for general
management of Calico configuration regardless of whether you are running Calico
on VMs, containers or bare metal.

This user reference is organized in sections based on the top level command options
of calicoctl.
